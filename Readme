How to run;
-----------
From command line:
-------------------
Go to the directory where jar file is located and run the bellow commands
1. mvn clean install
2. java -jar 07072018-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The client code of this program is pre configured with the sample theater layout given in the problem statement
for simplicity reasons.
The program can be extended for any theater with different seat layouts just by feeding the layout information
from different clients but leaving as it is.

When you run the program the very first time, it displays rows and sections in the form of a multi dimentional array structure
followed by 'theater capacity' on a separate line.
The program starts instructing the user to enter the (patronNameSPACEnumber) and hit enter button.
Input validation is in place to check for the number >=1.

If the seats are found, the amount of seats available after the first pattern is displayed. This is not in the requirements
but I felt it should be there for more informative reasons to the user and added to the output section.

The user is expected to continue entering the inputs till no seat is available.
You can exit the program by letting the user to give the * (star) command anytime though this should be avoided.

When the theater is full, the output of tickets is displayed in the same order as the inputs are entered.


Note:
Looks like the sample input is searching any 2 rows at once to find the exact of the requested seats to the each of the sections
but that use case is not included in the program as it is not mentioned in the original seating rules of the problem statement.
